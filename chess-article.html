                <p class="article-p">
                    Chess is one of the oldest and most popular games played on this planet. With rules that primarily
                    haven’t changed for the past millennia, taking the time to learn the game of chess will allow you to
                    connect with the countless players around the world. The premise of chess is fairly simple, players
                    take turns moving their pieces, and capturing opponents’ pieces(This usually happens when you move
                    your piece over an opponent). The game ends when the capture of a player’s king is inevitable.
                </p>
                <h4>Setting Up The Board</h4>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The starting position of chess is never changing, the board consists of an 8x8 grid with alternating
                    coloured squares where a piece occupies one square of the grid. A row is called a rank and is
                    numbered away from the white pieces. A column is called a file, files have a letter associated with
                    them, where the leftmost file for the white player is “A” and the rightmost is “H”. In a game of
                    chess, there are two sets of pieces, white and black.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The sets consist of the following pieces. I’ve given the most common design but it may change from
                    set to set. Although the design of the pieces may vary, the quantities will never change:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- 8 Pawns, these are shaped like a horn with a ball on the tip</li>
                    <li>- 2 Rooks, these are shaped like small castle towers</li>
                    <li>- 2 Knights, these are shaped like horses</li>
                    <li>- 2 Bishops, these are shaped like big pawns with a slit in the top</li>
                    <li>- 1 King, these are shaped with a cross on top, in person, it is typically the largest piece
                    </li>
                    <li>- 1 Queen, these are shaped with ridges on the top that resemble a crown</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Moving the Pieces</h4>

                <h5>The Pawn</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The pawn is the most common piece on the board at the start of the game. The pawn can move in a
                    straight line, one square at a time. The exception to this is on the pawn’s first move where you can
                    choose to move it two squares forward, or just one square forward. Note that a pawn cannot move over
                    another piece, if there is a piece blocking its path it can only move up to it.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">When capturing the pawn can only capture diagonally. The two squares which a pawn
                    can capture on are the squares to the left and right of the square in front of the pawn. When a
                    piece is in one of these squares and you wish to capture it (capturing a piece is not a
                    requirement), you move the pawn to that square and remove the opponent's piece.
                </p>
                <div class="img-center-container-small">

                <p class="img-center-container caption">A simple interaction between pawns, with the white pawn
                    capturing the black</p>

                <h5>The Bishop</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The bishop can only move diagonally, it cannot jump over pieces and must either stop at the diagonal
                    square before an obstructing piece or capture it if it is an opponent's piece and you choose to do
                    so. When capturing, the bishop simply moves into a square which an opponent piece is on.
                </p>

                    black</p>

                <h5>The Rook</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The movement of the rook is similar to the bishop, only the rook moves along the rows and the
                    columns. The rook can move along a row or column for an unlimited amount of time unless there is
                    another piece in its path. If this is an opponent’s piece the rook may capture it by moving into the
                    square occupied by the opponent’s piece.
                </p>

                    captures the pawn</p>

                <h5>The Knight</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The knight is a little tricky to master its movement. This mainly comes from the fact that it can
                    move over pieces and is only limited by its range of movement rather than what pieces are in front
                    of it. The knight can move in an L shape. It moves two squares down a rank or file, and then one
                    square perpendicular to the two squares. This means that the maximum possible moves a knight can
                    have are 8; however, your knight cannot move onto a square with your piece nor can it move off the
                    board.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">
                    A knight can capture any piece of your opponent’s which is on a square that the
                    knight can legally move to. To perform the capture, move your knight onto the square and remove your
                    opponent's piece.
                </p>

                <h5>The Queen</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    In chess, the queen is the most powerful piece on the board. This is because of the versatility of
                    the queen, as it is the chess piece that has the largest range of motion. The queen is the
                    combination of a rook and a bishop. It can move down ranks, files, and diagonals until there is a
                    piece in its path. If this piece is an opponent’s piece it can capture it by taking the opponent’s
                    piece’s spot and removing the piece.
                </p>

                <p class="img-center-container caption">An interaction where the queen captures both the knight and the
                    rook</p>

                <h5>The King</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The king is the most important piece in your arsenal. One loses the game if their king can no longer
                    escape capture, this is called “checkmate”. If a king is in the path of an opponent’s piece it is in
                    “check”. You must either move your king, capture the piece which is in a position to attack it or
                    put a piece in between that prevents the opponent from capturing your king(This is impossible if the
                    attacking piece is a knight).
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The movement of a king is the same as a queen, although a king can only move one square in each
                    direction. Kings can capture by taking the piece in its path, however, you cannot move your king
                    into a position that puts the king in check. You can also not move a piece of your own that will put
                    your king in check.
                </p>
                <div class="img-center-container-small">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="article-img-small" src="https://nazarchamp.github.io/ChessStuff/king-example.gif">
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p class="img-center-container caption">In this position the king starts out in check, he escapes to the
                    right but is then placed in check again. The king then captures the rook in the h file, only to be
                    put in checkmate by the queen. The king can’t take the queen as if he does he will be captured by
                    the rook.</p>

                <h4>Advanced Movement and Rules</h4>

                <h5>Pawn Promotion</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    When a pawn reaches the rank furthermost from its player(The 8th for white and the 1st for black) it
                    can turn into any piece the player decides, other than a pawn. Typically, this piece is the queen as
                    it is the most powerful although there are very specific situations where a knight is preferred.
                </p>
                <div class="img-center-container-small">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="article-img-small"
                            src="https://nazarchamp.github.io/ChessStuff/promotion-example.gif">

                </div>
                <p class="img-center-container caption">In this scenario the white pawn moves to the fifth rank, the
                    black pawn moves two squares allowing for the white pawn to capture</p>

                <h5>En Passante</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    En Passante is the only time in chess when a capture can occur without having your piece occupy the
                    square of your opponent’s piece. When a pawn is on the 5th rank and is white, or the 4th rank and is
                    black, and a pawn of the opponent’s moves two squares to the space immediately next to your pawn, on
                    the move immediately after you may capture your opponent’s pawn by moving to the square that your
                    opponent’s pawn would be on if it had only moved one square forward instead of two. En Passante can
                    only occur on the move directly after your opponent moves his pawn two squares.
                </p>

                    black pawn moves two squares allowing for the white pawn to capture</p>

                <h5>Castling</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The king in chess starts out in a fairly exposed position as he is located towards the middle. A
                    common way to get the king out of the middle is to castle, this involves moving both the king and
                    rook in one turn. Castling is the only time in chess where two of your pieces can be moved in one
                    turn.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">To castle, the following things must be true:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- The king must not have been moved in the game</li>
                    <li>- The rook that is being castled must not have moved in the game</li>
                    <li>- No piece is in between your king and rook</li>
                    <li>- The king must not be in check</li>
                    <li>- No opponent's piece may be able to move in between your rook and king</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="article-p">
                    If the above conditions are met then you are allowed to castle. To castle you move your king two
                    units into the direction of the rook which you are using to castle, and you move the rook to the
                    square on the other side of the king. Moving your king to the side where the queen used to be is
                    called a queen-side castle while castling to the other side is called a king-side castle. Castling
                    is a very effective way of getting the king into a safer position. A good strategy is to avoid
                    moving your king or one of your rooks if you can as it allows for your option to castle to remain
                    open.

                <h5>Drawing the Game</h5>
                <p class="article-p">Chess doesn’t need to end in one player winning and the other player losing. In
                    fact, chess games will often end in a tie.</p>
                <p class="article-p" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">There are six ways a Chess game can end in a tie they
                    are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">- Insufficient Material. This occurs when checkmate is impossible
                        for either player. This
                        happens when the only pieces on the board are any of the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Two kings</li>
                            <li>- Two kings and one bishop or knight</li>
                            <li>- Two kings and each player has only one bishop or knight</li>
                            <li>- Two kings and two knights</li>
                        </ul>
                        In any of these positions, a win is impossible and the game is automatically drawn. Note that it
                        is technically possible to win if a player has a king, a knight, and a bishop although it is
                        extremely hard and usually results in one of the other draw conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        - Threefold Repetition. If throughout an entire game, a single position is repeated three times
                        the game is automatically drawn. Think of it like if you could take three pictures of the
                        chessboard on separate moves and they would all be the same, the game is drawn.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        - 50 Pawnless Moves. If 50 moves have occurred(50 moves from each player) and in these 50 moves
                        no
                        pawn has been moved, and no capture has occurred the game is drawn.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        - Stalemate. If a king is not in check, but there is no move that a player may make that will
                        not
                        put his king in check the game is automatically drawn. This draw possibility is unfortunate as
                        typically one player has an advantage and should have won but forces a stalemate.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        - Insufficient Material vs Time. If playing a timed chess game and a player runs out of time,
                        but
                        his opponent does not have enough pieces to checkmate the game is drawn. However, no matter how
                        poorly the player who ran out of time must play, if there is a possible checkmate, the player
                        with time remaining wins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Agreement. To avoid long chess games, if two players agree that a game should end in a draw
                        the game ends in a draw.
                    </li>

                <h4>Basic Strategy</h4>
                <p class="article-p">Each piece in chess has been assigned a value based on its usefulness in the game
                    and how important it is to protect it.</p>
                <p class="article-p">The values for each piece can be found in the following table:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Piece Name</th>

            <p class="img-center-container caption">*A bishop is considered of more value than a knight because of its
                range of motion. If you prefer a knight over a bishop, there is nothing wrong, especially at a low to
                mid-skill level, with taking an opponent's knight while losing your bishop. Just know that chess engines
                will typically tell you to keep your bishop. When doing calculations with other pieces you consider a
                bishop a 3, only when comparing it to a knight does it become 3.15.</p>
            <p class="article-p">When you are deciding whether or not to capture an opponent's piece you should be
                looking into how many points you will be taking away from your opponent as opposed to how many points
                you will be gaining. For example, if your knight takes an opponent's pawn, only for the knight to be
                taken by your opponent in the next move you have lost 2 points in that exchange. On the other hand, if
                you capture an opponent's rook with a bishop and he captures the bishop you have just gained two points.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">Small caveats exist in the point-based system. It is seldom advisable to give up two
                knights or bishops just to take a rook and a pawn. Both are worth 6 points, but the former has more
                potential in creating positions where you gain points. It is also rarely advised when just beginning
                chess to trade a queen for a point equivalent. Typically you only trade a queen for a queen.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">The king is valued at an infinite scale, this means that no matter what the cost you
                should trade any amount of pieces for a king. If it requires getting rid of a queen, a rook, and a
                couple of pawns to get a checkmate you should take that option as you win the game and point totals
                don’t matter at that point anymore.</p>

            <h5>Controlling the Center</h5>
            <p class="article-p">The start of a chess game is extremely important as it dictates the opportunities that
                will present themselves going into the middle and the end of the game. By placing as many of your pieces
                into the center of the chessboard you create the most opportunity for your chess pieces. Even if you
                don’t utilize all these opportunities simply having them is an advantage. If you can develop your pieces
                into the center you will almost certainly see an increase in your win rate.
            </p>

            <h5>Slow Down and Look Around</h5>
            <p class="article-p">There are a lot of pieces on a chessboard and sometimes it may be hard not to overlook
                an opponent's piece. To improve your chess you don’t need to see 5 moves into the future, simply being
                able to see every piece on the board and what it’s attacking is enough for you to increase your rating
                when you’re starting out.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">When you decide to make a move you should first check all of your opponent's pieces and
                look as to whether or not they are in a position to attack any one of your pieces. If your pieces aren’t
                defended, meaning you can’t recapture the piece for an even or greater amount of points then you should
                really consider defending your piece. It’s also important to look around as to ways that an opponent can
                put your king into check. Even if you think a piece is covered double-check to make sure that your
                opponent can’t take that piece. Especially double check if the only coverage you have on the piece being
                attacked is your king. Remember, a king can never capture to put itself in check.
            </p>

            <h4>What Should You Do Next?</h4>
            <p class="article-p">This tutorial has only been designed to give you the absolute basics for you to be able
                to fully play chess. The only next step is to play lots of games. When you first start out playing
                you’ll start noticing patterns and certain positions that come up over and over again. It’s important
                that if you notice a position that has been occurring a lot or just an interesting position in general,
                analyze that position and see what the correct moves are. There are a lot of great free chess analyzing
                programs, and most of the online chess websites have built-in analysis.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">Doing chess puzzles is also important as the puzzles will bring up certain positions
                and patterns that you may run into. I found that the best website for playing chess and doing puzzles is
                <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">At the end of the day though, when starting out chess is a numbers game, the more games
                you play the better you will be at playing, and although you may lose a lot at first soon you’ll start
                improving and might end up writing a tutorial of your own one day.
