                    Carving a pumpkin is a widely partaken-in activity around Halloween. Although, if it’s your first
                    time carving or you haven’t carved in a long time it can be a confusing process that can leave you
                    second-guessing yourself through every step. However, if you follow along with this tutorial you’ll
                    be able to carve a pumpkin like the one below with ease.

                <h4>Preparing to Carve a Pumpkin</h4>
                <h5>Picking a Pumpkin</h5>
                <p class="article-p">
                    First, before we can start carving a pumpkin you need to pick out a suitable pumpkin. Pumpkins which
                    are the best for carving for beginners typically have the following properties:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>- An even spherical or ellipsoidal shape</li>
                    <li>- A flat bottom</li>
                    <li>- A uniform dark orange colouring, slight blemishes on the skin are fine, but bruised pumpkins
                        should be avoided.</li>
                    <li>- A smooth texture on the skin of the pumpkin</li>
                    <li>- A diameter of around 30cm</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="article-p">Pumpkins are sold in most large stores; however, pumpkins that are the best for
                    carving are those that go first. So if you are planning on carving a pumpkin, purchase a pumpkin
                    while you still have plenty of choices and aren’t left with choosing between those that have been
                    left over. It’s important to know that once a pumpkin is broken it will start to show signs of decay
                    within 3-5 days. So if you want to display your pumpkin on Halloween, restrain yourself from the
                    urge to carve the pumpkin until Halloween day or the night before.</p>

                    in rot, prematurely ruining your pumpkin. Source: <a

                <h5>Collecting the Tools</h5>
                <p class="article-p">You may have seen a lot of specialized tools for carving a pumpkin sold in
                    different stores. These tools are nice to have but if you're just getting into carving pumpkins you
                    will be fine in not spending money on the fancy kit and using items you have lying around at home.
                    The following items are used to carve a pumpkin:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Old newspapers or another disposable covering</li>
                    <li>- A sharp long-bladed knife, blade of around 8 inches and not bendable</li>
                    <li>- A smaller-bladed knife, make sure the blade can fully go through your pumpkin’s skin and is
                        not bendable</li>
                    <li>- A spoon with a large handle</li>
                    <li>- A fork or other poking tool</li>
                    <li>- White paper, or a printed graphic</li>
                    <li>- A black marker</li>
                    <li>- Tape</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="article-p">In a carving set, you will typically get saws that can replace the small knife,
                    some scooper that can replace the spoon, and an awl that can replace the fork.
                </p>
                <h5>Deciding What to Carve</h5>
                <p class="article-p">Deciding what to carve is a challenge within itself. Since you are just starting
                    out it’s best to keep it simple. Draw the design on paper to the scale you want it on your pumpkin,
                    if you make a mistake, redraw it on a different piece of paper so you don’t confuse yourself later.
                    If you’re like me and are too lazy to sit down and draw a design you can search for “Pumpkin Carving
                    Stencils” and print the design which you want off. Note that a design with a landscape orientation
                    will be easier to attach to your pumpkin.
                </p>
                <h4>Carving the Pumpkin</h4>
                <h5>Hollow Out Your Pumpkin</h5>
                <p class="article-p">First, we need to hollow out the inside of your pumpkin. Set your pumpkin on the
                    newspaper/covering as this could get messy. Begin by tracing a circle around the stem, around an
                    inch away from the actual stem. Then using your large knife, cut a hole into the top of your pumpkin
                    around the stem. Make sure that while you are cutting you angle the knife toward the center of your
                    pumpkin. This will create a ridge that the stem part which you are cutting will sit on.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">After you have completed the cut remove the stem but make sure not to throw it
                    away. Finally with your spoon scoop out the insides of the pumpkin. The seeds can be eaten if you
                    roast them and there are plenty of online tutorials for this. If you don’t want to eat the seeds you
                    can keep them unseparated with the stringy insides which can be composted or thrown out in the
                    garbage. Make sure you completely scoop out the insides so that the inside of your pumpkin is dry.
                </p>
                <h5>Prepare the Design</h5>
                <p class="article-p">Attach the paper with the design to your pumpkin by taping it. Make sure that the
                    paper is taught and isn’t hanging loosely around the pumpkin. Using your poking tool poke holes on
                    the lines which you wish to carve out. The holes which you poke don’t need to go all the way through
                    the pumpkin’s skin but need to be visible to you. After you have poked holes along all your desired
                    cut lines you can remove and discard the paper.
                </p>
                <h5>Cutting The Pumpkin</h5>
                <p class="article-p">Using the smaller knife cut along the lines which you made visible with your poking
                    tool. Make sure that your cut goes completely through the skin of the pumpkin so that the piece can
                    be removed. If you need to make sharp corners don’t be afraid to pull your knife out of the pumpkin
                    and cut from a different angle. This is the most dangerous part of the process so be careful to not
                    cut your fingers. Make sure to never have your hand inside of the pumpkin while cutting as it is
                    really easy to miscalculate the position of your hand and poke it with the point of your knife’s
                    blade.
                </p>
                <h4>Presentation and Next Steps</h4>
                <p class="article-p">Now that you have carved your pumpkin it’s time to display it. You can put a candle
                    inside of it to give it that classic glow. I suggest going out and purchasing an LED candle as it
                    will last as long as the battery powering it, can be reused, and doesn’t have any wax that spills
                    out inside of the pumpkin.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">This tutorial gives you all the steps to carving a pumpkin. However, pumpkin
                    carving is like any other skill and you will only get better at it with more practice. Try carving
                    slightly more difficult graphics into your pumpkin the next time you carve, and slowly but surely
                    you will become the best carver in your neighbourhood.
