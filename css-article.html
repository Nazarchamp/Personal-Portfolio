                <h4>What is HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Every website you open has something in common whether it be a complicated website with lots of
                    bells and whistles like Instagram, or a simple website that contains the answer to that one
                    chemistry question on your assignment. The connecting link that makes a website a website is that
                    they all use HTML and CSS. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is essentially the bones of a website.
                    It broadly defines what elements are in a website. For instance, it can define a heading, a
                    paragraph, an image, or even another website inside yours; However, if you only look at our bones
                    each person seems nearly identical, that’s where Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) come in. CSS styles
                    the website, with CSS you can add colours, borders, transitions, animations, and other aesthetic
                    devices.
                </p>
                <h4>Getting Started With HTML</h4>
                <p class="article-p">
                    HTML is made up of elements - pieces of a website that each serve a purpose. There are elements for
                    virtually every part of a website, specific elements exist for: images, headings, paragraphs, entire
                    sections, forms, and many others. An element for a paragraph looks like the following:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">p</span>&gt;<span class="w">Some Text</span>&lt;/<span class="b">p</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">
                    In between the first set of &lt;&gt; we have the name of the element, which is "p", what HTML uses
                    for
                    paragraphs. “&lt;p&gt;” is called the opening tag of the element. The closing tag is “&lt;/p&gt;”,
                    and in
                    between the opening and closing tags are the text content of the element. Note, some elements,
                    like an image, don’t have text content within them, these elements don’t have a closing tag, and
                    are just contained in one opening tag.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">Some other examples of tags are: </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">h2</span>&gt;<span class="w">Some Text</span>&lt;/<span
                        class="b">h2</span>&gt;<br>
                    &lt;<span class="b">div</span>&gt;<span class="w">Some Text</span>&lt;/<span
                        class="b">div</span>&gt;<br>
                    &lt;<span class="b">br</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">The “h2” is a tag for the second-largest heading, there exist “h1”-”h6” tags just
                    for headings. The “div” tag is just a container, we’ll discuss it in more detail later. The “br” tag
                    is a break line tag and it acts essentially as an enter key. This is useful as HTML will remove all
                    unnecessary enter keys before running. Notice how it’s a self-closing tag.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">A list of elements can be found at: <a
                        href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP">W3Schools</a></p>
                <h4>More Advanced HTML</h4>
                <p class="article-p">Some elements of websites carry more data than just content text. Images contain
                    links to the image, same with videos, and regular old links contain both content text and a link. We
                    give elements these extra values inside of the opening tag in the form of attributes. For example
                    below is an image tag:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">img</span> <span class="lb">src</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"Image.png"</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">In this tag the attribute declaring part is src=“Image.png”, here we set the
                    attribute of the source of the image (Called “src” in HTML) to the value “Image.png”. This tells the
                    HTML to display the Image.png file as an image on the website. All attribute declarations follow
                    this format.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">Below are some common attribute declarations within elements:</p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">img</span> <span class="lb">src</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"Image.png"</span> <span class="lb">alt</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"Image Sample"</span>&gt;
                    <br>&lt;<span class="b">button</span> <span class="lb">type</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"submit"</span>&gt;
                    <br>&lt;<span class="b">a</span> <span class="lb">href</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"www.google.com"</span>&gt;<span class="w">Link</span>&lt;/<span
                        class="b">a</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">The first image tag adds an alt element, the “alt” is the text that displays if a
                    user doesn’t have an image and displays only text, usually, this happens if they use a screen
                    reader. The second element is a button, specifically, a submit button which is used extensively in
                    forms. The final element is a link, the “href” is the actual link part which is where you’ll go if
                    you click the link, and the content is what you see as the link on the website.
                </p>
                <h4>Nested HTML Tags</h4>
                <p class="article-p">HTML elements can also be put into each other for logical ordering. For instance,
                    you might want an element that contains all the links in your navigation menu. To put HTML elements
                    inside of each other put the element to nest inside of the content section:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">div</span>&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="b">p</span>&gt;<span class="w">Nested Text</span>&lt;/<span
                        class="b">p</span>&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/<span class="b">div</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">Here we put a paragraph tag inside of a div container. </p>
                <h4>Getting Started With CSS</h4>
                <p class="article-p">All the HTML we have written right now has nothing more than the basic styling on
                    it, if you want to add custom styling we use CSS. CSS is filled with style declarations, a style
                    declaration looks like the following:
                </p>
                <p class="code"><span class="lb">background-color</span><span class="w">:</span> <span
                        class="o">#000000</span><span class="w">;</span></p>
                <p class="article-p">Here we set the background colour style to be the hexadecimal colour black. All CSS
                    declarations follow this basic format.</p>
                <p class="article-p">A full list of style declarations can be found at: <a
                        href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref">W3Schools</a></p>
                <h4>Adding CSS to HTML</h4>
                <p class="article-p">To add style to an element you have three options, inline, internal, and external.
                </p>
                <h5>Inline Styling</h5>
                <p class="article-p">For Inline styling you add all your styles into the attribute style on an html
                    element. To set the width and height of our image from before using inline:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">img</span> <span class="lb">src</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"Image.png"</span>
                    <span class="lb">style</span><span class="w">=</span><span class="o">"width:100px;
                        height:100px;"</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">Here we take our image from last time and we make it have the fixed size of 100px
                    by 100px.</p>
                <h5>Internal Styling</h5>
                <p class="article-p">For Internal styling we use the special HTML tag: "&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;" and
                    inside we put our CSS
                    declarations. The declarations in here are a little different because they need to say what element
                    they’re targeting, they will look like:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">style</span>&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="y">img</span><span class="w">{</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lb">width</span><span
                        class="w">:</span> <span class="g">100px</span><span class="w">;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lb">height</span><span
                        class="w">:</span> <span class="g">100px</span><span class="w">;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="w">}</span><br>
                    &lt;/<span class="b">style</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">The tag before the curly brackets is the target, here we apply the style to all
                    images. If we want to target only some elements we can use classes and IDs. A class is an identifier
                    that you add to multiple elements, you add a class to an element by using the attribute class in an
                    HTML element. You can add multiple classes by separating them with a space. An ID is a label for
                    only one element. We add it with the attribute id to HTML elements.
                </p>

                <p class="article-p">To reference classes or IDs in an internal stylesheet we use a “.” before the class
                    name or
                    a “#” before an ID name. Implementing all that we’ve learned so far we have:
                </p>

                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">style</span>&gt;<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="y">div</span><span class="w">{</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lb">background-color</span><span
                        class="w">:</span> <span class="o">black</span><span class="w">;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="w">}</span><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="y">#heading</span><span class="w">{</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lb">text-transform</span><span

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="w">}</span><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="y">.red-text</span><span class="w">{</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="lb">color</span><span
                        class="w">:</span> <span class="o">red</span><span class="w">;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="w">}</span><br>

                    &lt;/<span class="b">style</span>&gt;<br><br>

                    &lt;<span class="b">div</span>&gt;<br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="b">h1</span> <span class="lb">class</span><span

                        Website</span>&lt;/<span class="b">h1</span>&gt;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<span class="b">p</span> <span class="lb">class</span><span
                        class="w">=</span><span class="o">"red-text"</span>&gt;<span class="w">Lorem
                        Ipsum</span>&lt;/<span class="b">p</span>&gt;<br>

                    &lt;/<span class="b">div</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">This creates the website:</p>

                <div class="img-center-container" style="margin-top: 0px;">
                    <figure style="margin-top: 0px;">
                        <img class="article-img" src="assets/images/css-example.png" style="margin-top: 8px;">
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p class="article-p">Here we have an “h1” element and “p” element nested within a “div” element. We
                    style all divs with a black background colour, we assign both texts a class of “red-text” and we
                    make all text for the element with an ID of “heading” to be uppercase.
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">Notice that to run the HTML file all we do is open the file in a web browser.
                    Note, all HTML files must end with .html, and all CSS files must end with .css
                </p>
                <h5>External Styling</h5>
                <p class="article-p">Finally to use external CSS, we copy the inner text of the style element into an
                    external file and then we reference it with the following HTML tag:
                </p>
                <p class="code">
                    &lt;<span class="b">link</span> <span class="lb">rel</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="lb">href</span><span class="w">=</span><span
                        class="o">"index.css"</span>&gt;
                </p>
                <p class="article-p">Here, we import the external stylesheet located in the file index.css</p>
                <h4>What's Next?</h4>
                <p class="article-p">We have now learned the basics of HTML and CSS. We know the structure of HTML and
                    CSS and how to run it. All websites use the following structure which we have defined and we are now
                    well on our way to creating more advanced websites. The best way for you to further your knowledge
                    now is to start making websites. Create ideas of what you want in your website, and then research
                    how to do it if you do not know. This is the way I learned, and hopefully, it will serve you well.
