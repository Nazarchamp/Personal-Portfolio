                    So you’ve noticed the little lock at the top of your browser next to the URL and are wondering what
                    that means, or alternatively, you noticed the triangle with an exclamation mark and are worried you
                    might be the victim of a cybercrime. Either way this article is here to explain what a “secure” vs
                    “insecure” website is according to your browser.
                </p>
                <h4>How Does the Internet Work?</h4>
                <p class="article-p">
                    Every web page is a collection of multiple types of media, which is commonly called hypermedia. This
                    media ranges from text to images to videos to JavaScript - a programming language that is used to
                    make a website interactive as opposed to just static videos and text. In order for you to be able to
                    view a website, you must request the media of the website from the server. The server will then send
                    you back the media using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is also the means by which you
                    communicate with the server, for example if you fill out a form on a website and click submit that
                    form information will be sent to the server for processing through HTTP.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p class="img-center-container caption">A diagram of the usages of HTTP in providing the internet</p>
                <h4>What’s the Problem With HTTP?</h4>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The main issue with sending data over HTTP is that it is sent in plain text. This means that while
                    the media is being sent over the vast arrays of wires and electromagnetic waves of the internet
                    anyone who intercepts it can read it just like you. This can become problematic if you’re sending
                    sensitive information in a form, like passwords and usernames. If you send a password using just
                    HTTP, anyone who can handle it will now know your password. Considering that most people access the
                    internet from a wireless access point, if you are sending a password through HTTP anyone connected
                    to the same Wi-Fi as you would be able to read your password. Even if you don’t use wireless
                    internet, your data is sent from your router to a handful of routers and finally to the server,
                    which you don’t have a guarantee isn’t connected to the internet. Any one of these routers could
                    intercept your password.
                </p>
                <h4>What’s the Solution?</h4>
                <p class="article-p">
                    The solution to our problem comes from adding encryption to HTTP. An encrypted version of HTTP is
                    called Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS uses the encryption protocol Transport
                    Layer Security (TLS). When you use HTTPS every bit of communication with the server is encrypted.
                    This means that only you and the server can read the message, if anyone else tries to read it, the
                    message will look like gibberish. In order to create this encryption each server needs to have a
                    special certificate which gets shared with you at the start that you use to encrypt your messages.
                    Anyone can make one of these certificates; however, to have the padlock in the top of your browser
                    window, this certificate must come from a certificate authority. A certificate authority is a
                    company that provides certificates to websites only if they can verify they are who they say they
                    are. Some advanced hackers can fake their URL so that they can put their fake website on a real URL
                    like: “www.gmail.com”, but they won’t ever be able to replicate the certificate because they don’t
                    actually own “www.gmail.com” so there will be a triangle in the top left corner.

                <p class="img-center-container caption">A picture of an SSL certificate for all websites that fall under
                    the google.com domain</p>
                <h4>Am I Safe?</h4>
                <p class="article-p">If you see the little lock in the top right of your screen the website you're
                    visiting has good security and you shouldn’t be worried about having your data sniffed, or the
                    website being impersonated. However, still be vigilant for instance “www.faceboook.com” (With three
                    Os) could have a valid certificate and pretend to be the real Facebook, so make sure you’re checking
                    the URL as well. When it comes to seeing the little triangle in the top left corner is where it gets
                    more blurry. You should never input sensitive data into any website that has the triangle
                    displaying, but if you will only use the website to view information, and you don’t care that
                    someone can track what you're viewing then go ahead. A good way to determine if it’s safe without
                    HTTPS is if you would be willing to have a complete stranger stand over your shoulder as you use the
                    website.
