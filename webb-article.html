            <article>
                <p class="article-p">Later this month, NASA will launch the James Webb telescope into outer space. Not
                    often do telescopes get launched into space, but when they do, they allow us to see and understand
                    our universe in ways we thought previously unimaginable.
                </p>
                <h4>How Does the James Webb Telescope Work?</h4>
                <p class="article-p" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The James Webb telescope will be equipped with four
                    different measurement tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">- NIRCAM, a near-infrared camera and the primary imager of the
                        James Webb Telescope. It is designed to be able to detect the earliest galaxies and stars and
                        also newer stars in the Milky Way. It also has a coronagraph, which is a device that can block
                        out a strong light source to view weaker lights around it. This is very helpful when looking at
                        distant solar systems, where the star is a very bright light source, and the planets are much
                        dimmer.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">- NIRSPEC, a near-infrared spectrometer. A spectrometer
                        is a device that breaks apart the light given off by an object. Each element gives off a unique
                        set of infrared light in different wavelengths, analyzing this information the James Webb
                        Telescope will allow us to determine the chemical composition of celestial bodies. These
                        wavelengths also
                        change based on mass and temperature, allowing us to determine the mass and temperature of
                        celestial bodies.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">- MIRI, a mid-infrared spectrometer. MIRI will capture the
                        infrared light that is longer than what NIRCAM can detect. This will allow it to capture highly
                        redshifted objects. Red shifted objects are those which are moving fast away from the viewing
                        point, which stretches the light released. MIRI will give us the stunning pictures typically
                        associated with space telescopes.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">- FGS/NIRISS, the Fine Guidance Sensor and
                        Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph. This device has several functioning modes to
                        allow it to accomplish different tasks. When using FGS the device helps precisely position the
                        telescope to focus on tiny portions of the sky. The Sltless Spectograph accomplishes the same
                        purpose as NIRSPEC, but it doesn’t have a slit that is used to focus light. This means it can
                        collect lots of data as it doesn’t have to focus on a small area. The Slitless Spectrograph will
                        be used for finding new exoplanets and bright flashes of light possibly from explosions.

                <p class="article-p">The four main tools are hidden inside the James Webb telescope. The parts of the
                    James Webb Telescope which are easily recognizable in
                    the pictures are the infrared shield and the large gold-plated mirror. </p>
                <p class="article-p" style="margin-top: 10px!important;">Since the James Webb Telescope is very
                    dependent on infrared measurements,
                    background heat that may alter these measurements needs to be reduced. The largest and only source
                    of this background heat is the sun, for which an infrared shield has been developed. The
                    infrared shield is the reflective tennis field-sized fabric underneath the telescope, it’s made of
                    Kapton
                    with an aluminum coating on the sides that will face the sun. The first two layers are also coated
                    with silicon to reflect more of the sun's heat. The odd shape of the shield also allows for heat
                    trapped inside of the sun shield more easily escape out of the sides of the shield and not linger in
                    between the layers.</p>
                <p class="article-p">To capture an image, a telescope needs to be able to focus light and heat into a
                    small point, this is where the mirror of the James Webb Telescope comes in. The mirror is made up of
                    18 hexagons which form a circular shape. Each hexagon is individually controlled by its own motors
                    and will all be positioned to reflect light into a single focal point. Each hexagon is made of
                    beryllium, which is highly reflective. Then they are coated with gold, which is even more reflective
                    than beryllium. </p>

                <h4>Where Will the James Web Telescope Orbit</h4>
                <p class="article-p">For the James Webb Telescope to be able to limit the background heat and light, it
                    needs to block out the vast amount of light released by the sun. This task alone is easy, while in
                    orbit, just face away from the sun. However, the light of the sun likes to reflect off the moon.
                    If the moon and sun aren’t both in a line from the telescope it will create a setup where no matter
                    where you turn you get light or heat pollution. The solution to this is to simply have the moon and
                    sun line up
                    constantly. For this we need to be in something called a Lagrange point, the second Lagrange point
                    to be exact.</p>
                <p class="article-p">A Lagrange point is a position where two other celestial objects that have a
                    gravitational effect on you stay in the same position relative to you. For the James Webb Telescope,
                    the two celestial body system consists of the Earth and the Sun. This means that in a Lagrange
                    point, you could at any time check the distance between you and the earth and it would be the same,
                    no matter where you are in your orbit.</p>
                <p class="article-p">The second Lagrange point is the one where the earth and the sun always line up.
                    This allows for the James Webb Telescope to block out both the sun and the earth(By extension the
                    moon as well). This is the position in which the James Webb Telescope will orbit, meaning that the
                    early days after the launch will be spent getting to the Lagrange point.</p>

                <h4>Hubble vs Webb</h4>
                <p class="article-p">The telescope which most people are familiar with is the Hubble telescope, and it
                    is a common misconception that the James Webb Telescope is a replacement for Hubble. However, Hubble
                    and Webb have different purposes entirely. The Hubble space telescope is primarily designed to take
                    pictures of the visible light spectrum, light that a human could see. Hubble also has
                    near-ultraviolet capturing abilities and some near-infrared capturing abilities. The James Webb
                    telescope is designed to capture infrared. Even the near-infrared tools on the James Webb telescope
                    can capture frequencies twice as large as the maximum Hubble can. James Webb’s MIRI can even capture
                    infrared waves that have a frequency of 10x of what Hubble can capture. </p>

                <p class="article-p">By the time you are reading this, the James Webb telescope may already be in space,
                    it might have even reached the Lagrange point and have started sending back its first pictures. To
